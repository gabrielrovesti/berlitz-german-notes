## ✍️ Method

For each module:
1. Original instructions are **copied verbatim**
2. Exercises are **fully solved**
3. Every sentence is **translated into Italian**
4. Numbers, prices, and times are **written in words**  
   Example:
   - `16,20 €` → *sechzehn Euro zwanzig*
   - `13.30 Uhr` → *dreizehn Uhr dreißig*

This makes the notes usable even without audio support.
